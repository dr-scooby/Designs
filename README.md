# Designs
Coding Design patterns using Java.
This is the Factory design pattern.

Definition:
A Factory Pattern or Factory Method Pattern says that, define an interface or abstract class for creating an object but let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate. In other words, subclasses are responsible to create the instance of the class.
